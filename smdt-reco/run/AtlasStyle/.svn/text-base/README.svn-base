ATLAS Root style
=======================================================================

This package contains the following files:

- AtlasStyle.C: it contains the actual style definition. You can call it
  from any macro by doing something like:

  gROOT->LoadMacro("AtlasStyle.C");
  SetAtlasStyle();

- AtlasStyle.py: example of python wrapper for AtlasStyle.C, in case
  you prefer to use pyROOT.

- rootlogon.C: automatically loads the ATLAS style. Put in your
  working directory together with StyleAtlas.C, and you'll get the
  ATLAS style loaded by default any time you launch ROOT in that
  directory.

- dot.rootrc: this is an example of the .rootrc file you could put in
  you home directory to get the ATLAS style loaded any time you launch
  ROOT from any location, without having to copy the style file
  around. It contains the following lines:

  Unix.*.Root.DynamicPath:    .:$(ROOTSYS)/lib:$(HOME)/RootUtils/lib:
  
  This one tells ROOT where to look for libraries. It points to the
  current directory (.), the standard ROOT library location
  ($(ROOTSYS)/lib), and a custom location ($(HOME)/RootUtils/lib) that
  you should change to fit your needs.

  Unix.*.Root.MacroPath:      .:$(HOME)/RootUtils:

  This one tells root where to look for macros. It points to the
  current directory (.) and to a custom location ($(HOME)/RootUtils)
  that you should change to fit your needs.

  $(HOME)/RootUtils (or whatever is the name of your custom macro
  repository) is where you should put both your 'rootlogon.C' and
  'StyleAtlas.C' files in order to get the ATLAS style loaded by
  default without copying them around.

- AtlasUtils.C: a useful utility package, containing several function
  definitions, like the one to generate the ATLAS labe. You can load
  it in you plotting macro by doing:
  
  gROOT->LoadMacro("AtlasUtils.C");

  The file should be in you working directory, or in your custom macro
  repository defined in your .rootrc file, where you also should have
  put the AtlasStyle.C file. In this case, you can safely load it from
  anywhere.

- AtlasUtils.py: example of python wrapper for AtlasUtils.C, in case
  you prefer to use pyROOT.

- Example.C and nlofiles.root will produce an example plot. Just copy
  them in the directory with all the other style and utility files,
  and execute the macro. Enter root and do:
  
  .x Example.C

  If you setup your .rootrc file and your custom macro repository, in
  order to produce the example plots (AtlasExample.eps,
  AtlasExample.png, AtlasExample.pdf) you will juts need Example.C and
  nlofiles.root.
