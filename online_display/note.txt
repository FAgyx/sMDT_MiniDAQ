 There are only a few things you should need to do to run the code entirely on the linux machine. First is edit the rootlogon.C file and adjust the path to be wherever you place this sMDT folder on the linux machine.Then edit the CSMMiniDAQ.cpp file and change the IP address listed as the third argument on line 83 to be "localhost" instead of "141.211.96.35". After running make and creating the new CSMMiniDAQ.exe, you should be all set. Simply enter the sMDT directory and run the command: root -l 'macros/onlineDAQ.c(14174)'. Remember you need to be running this macro prior to starting the rundaq on the linux machine.
