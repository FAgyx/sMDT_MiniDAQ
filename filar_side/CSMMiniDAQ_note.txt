1. Filar card has 4 channels. Each channel has a ring buffer with 30 FIFOs.
    filar->fifostat; 
returns an unsigned int indicating the current FIFO full status, 
e.g. filar->fifostat returning 0x01030002 means channel4 has 1, channel3 has 3, channel2 has 0, channel1 has 2 full FIFOs.
Only if one fifo is full its data will be read out.

2. To access the first of the currently full fifo content, e.g. filar->fifostat = 0x00000001, call functions below to get the data size and a data pointer:
    datasize = (filar->ack1) & (0xFFFFF);        //1M word max (4M Byte)
    dataptr = (unsigned int *) uaddr[1][bufnr];  //bufnr indicates the current ring buffer index, ranges from 0 to 29.
After reading out the content of this fifo, call:
    filar->req1 = paddr[1][bufnr];
    bufnr++;
Then the filled FIFO status of channel1 will decrease by 1 due to this read.
